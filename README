This is a port of Matthew Russoto's chmdump to OSX Snow Leopard.

This patchset is limited to the minimal changes required to resurect the original
code.  No attempts have been made to further clean it up (e.g. fix warnings)
nor ensure its portability to other platforms.

Testing has been limited to exploding a couple of .chm files and checking some
of the resulting .html files.

The original lives at http://www.russotto.net/chm/.
